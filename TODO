implement HasBoundingBox for pointcloud
iterators for collections
unittest all the things
simplify use statements
rename moveAble
octree for voxel image
kdtree for 2d or generic
quadtree

any/all pc filter docs don't note that these are pc filters

has_position trait which then can implement many other traits by using the provided position (similar for others)

many tests are missing

filters for 3d

update README and tests

make proper crate

make kd-tree n-dimensional   (maybe the octree as well, but might be easier to implement quadtree)

make trees referencing via ids

filters should be directed

negating filters which can be used to e.g. create ring filters

for impls and structs only require as few traits as possible

own error enum

use get methods of Vec to have safer code

IO methods split from the impls / traits as algorithms on them

some structs / traits have 2d/3d specification even if they can only exist in one of the spaces. e.g. filter_circle can't have a 3d version, rename accordingly

*0.5   better than /2

update README (especially filters are missing now)

write tutorial / examples withing the README

trait for pointcloud?

method to directly add points to pc via coordinates

try to avoid dynamic traits

also implement is_buildable_nd etc. and make is_buildable_2d also is_buildable_nd

rustdoc!!!

inner/outer filter combinator -> outer && !inner

outlier removal (filter which holds a kdtree of the reference structure, calc median / medium distance to k-nearest
neighbours remove which are further than x, furthest x percent further than x times
median / average dist...   could take either kdtree or iterator or random access
and be destructible to kdtree)

segmantation detection
