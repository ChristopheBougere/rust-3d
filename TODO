octree for voxel image
kdtree for 2d or generic
quadtree

implement FooAssign where possible

IsScalable impl missing for LineSegment (and others?)

some Hash impls might lose precision

many more distance functions (ray, line segments, ...)

rename either the half edge or IsSearchableMesh methods, so the names match

remove / change IsTree trait

add categories to cargo file

some algorithms (e.g. bezier) can be ported to 3d, maybe write them directly generic over the dimension

filter_and_test sometimes fails

similar to distances, add intersections

support more ply formats or properly throw on error

searchable mesh currently only defined for tri mesh. consider making this generic / rename it
same for HalfEdge (likely that the specific version can be optimized better)

add more combinator filters to the random accessible filters

consider removing the new() from is buildable nd

trait for type with one or many normals (normal() or normal(id))

make the tests folder of the exact same structure and file names as src,
this way it becomes very easy to ensure everything is tested

many tests are missing

filters should be directed (this could be dropped and a TransFormed wrapper applied [which inverse transformes incoming points first])

drop the distances files, once the DistanceTo traits are implemented

search values of the trees (e.g. in_sphere) should require a Positive

make trees referencing via ids
also consider writing wrapper types which e.g. take a PC and parse the tree internally
this way, the tree and pc can never get async

should be possible to generalize the OutlierFilter to nd

outlier removal (filter which holds a kdtree of the reference structure, calc median / medium distance to k-nearest
neighbours remove which are further than x, furthest x percent further than x times
median / average dist...   could take either kdtree or iterator or random access
and be destructible to kdtree)

segmantation detection

IO methods for PC and mesh for all general file formats

octree is missing many query methods
(also implement quad tree once these are implemented)

douglas peucker 3D version (or generic?) also consider rewriting it to not require PC as type
proper docs / cleanup of douglas peucker

implement IsMatrix4Transformable and 3 for more types

reserve methods for more types or even traits

bounding box < - > box code duplication

use the for_each_intersecting solution at many more places, since this allows avoiding allocations easily (Trees, unifiy AABBTrees)

additionally to any() for trees, add all()
 -> also consider implementing at least iter(), which can then replace any of such helper methods
