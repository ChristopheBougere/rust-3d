implement HasBoundingBox for pointcloud
iterators for collections
unittest all the things
simplify use statements
rename moveAble
octree for voxel image
kdtree for 2d or generic
quadtree

has_position trait which then can implement many other traits by using the provided position (similar for others)

many tests are missing

filters for 3d

update README and tests

make proper crate

make kd-tree n-dimensional   (maybe the octree as well, but might be easier to implement quadtree)

make trees referencing via ids

filters should be directed

negating filters which can be used to e.g. create ring filters
