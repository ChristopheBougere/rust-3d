//@todo split HasPositionxD into reading and writing parts
//@todo this way NormalizedxD can be of this type and be used
//@todo in way more cases



//@todo implement for pointcloud (already has a method for bbox)
//@todo could be defined for any number of dimensions

//@todo currently it is not possible to create immutable trees because of this
//@todo add method, which builds from data directly
//@todo abstract to only use a HasPosition3D trait instead of Point3Ds
